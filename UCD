Service Account Name : SRVUCDAppNameBuildMgr

It's tool for continuous delivery
used to deploy to RTL envs whether it's monolithic or microservice appl
work like agent based (as need to have agent installed on target env where you want to connect & deploy so it can communicate from urbancode server)
Server -> (communicate to) Client {basically an agent or node on which UCD agent is installed, these r agentless deployment server where SSH authenticate with something like we do with Ansible but here we use agent based deployment}

Help Team:
  how to trigger deployment, map components, do approve process and create snapshots
  create version, adding version, kick off appl process deployment to lowermost env as part of Continuous delivery

Pre-requisite:
  i. agent    ii. RHEL 7 or higher and AIX 6 or higher

Add member:
  Go to profile -> Team manage -> Go to particular appl -> Click on hidden empty role (here we can edit/add/remove)

Auth Token:
  thsi token use in jenkins to connect to specific app in UCD

Main Terms:
  a. Environment
  b. History -
      history of all envs
      {Under history, click on Request process of particular process, go to manifest, show version, verify this version with Component version of Snapshots}
  c. Components -
        {IHS owned by WAS team}
  d. Snapshots -
      collection of specific version of component & process
      create once & deploy anywhere to RTLA
      {take a picture & pass it on}
      snapshot name - the change number will be prod change number & date as well

  e. Approval of request-
        need to check app name, requestor, why they are deploying

      [in UCD there is process which is like taking a screenshot last deployment(previous version components) in pre-prod(which deployment we need to replicate in prod) that can be tested & deployed in prod]

  f. createVersion-
       showing version on UCD so it's date stamp, buildNo. from Jenkins {REST API call from UCD}

  g. addVersionFiles-
        sending or attaching that version file & then based of JSON we framed then we request the appl process

Resource Tree- When we have access to agent, we can directly assign resource tree or can ask UCD team to do needful

Contact infra team for agent installation

need development mgr role in order to add agents to env by yourself

Under applications -> we create env -> under env, go to resource then add agent
