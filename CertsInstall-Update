1. First uninstall/remove previous certificate if we are going for update from /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors location
Remove : *.crt and *.pem (previous files)

2. Check list : trust list | grep certName
If same label name found
Then remove *.cer file from /etc/ssl/certs and /etc/pki/tls/certs

3. cd /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors
Run > update-ca-trust

4. Again see list - trust list | grep certName

5. Go to /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors and put newer certificate here

6. Go to /etc/pki/tls/certs
cp /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/certName.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs.cer


cp /etc/pli/ca-trust/source/anchors/certName.crt /etc/ssl/certs/certs.cer

Give proper permission to cer file

6. Now update
> update-ca-trust
