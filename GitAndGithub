Best Strategy:

1. Master Repo - that has current prod code
2. Release Repo - from feature repo create a pull request then code reviewer approve code to merge in master branch of Release repo. Thereafter automatically jenkins job run
3. Feature Repo - forked repo from Release one, where development team work

Automerge Release branch code to master branch
