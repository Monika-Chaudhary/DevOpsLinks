Jenkins is build orchestration tool and can integrate with UCD, GHE, JIRA,  SonarQube, Nexus, Gerrit, Veracode, Selenium,..
Jenkins is Code Integration(Phase 1) and Continuous Integration(Phase 2)
Jenkins compiles artifact , package artifact,...

Continuous Delivery & Deployment Platform:
	from jenkins package artifact and sent it to UCD
		(create service account & token for application in UCD to connect with jenkins. that token will authenticate via Jenkins server)

For dev & sit env we deploy through jenkins but for pre-prod & prod we use snapshot process manually
	{as per strategy anything shouldn't deployment to pre-prod & prod through Jenkins pipeline. Hence there will be end of pipeline in SIT env only.
	For deployment in pre-prod & prod, we have to adopt release management.
	so, we should use UCD tool to deploy code in prod & UCD process will be triggered  manually by env team or some release management team

------
1. Download jenkins war file

2. See compatible requirements for system and java

3. Log in as root user then create  /var/lib/jenkins2 directory

4. export JENKINS_HOME=/var/lib/jenkins2

5. go to /var/lib/jenkins2
	then put jenkins.war file here and run command : java -jar jenkins.war 

	if want to use another port then execute : java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8085

6. Go to browser to access jenkins by http://localhost:8080 (by default) or http://localhost:8085 (if give http port explicitly), now give initialized password then install plugins. After that it will ask for configure username and password

7. If somehow jenkins service stopped then run same commands as installation for start service like "java -jar jenkins.war" or "java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8085"

Implement sso in Jenkins
Https jenkins
Shared library in jenkins
_________
Automatic script for Jenkins:

Create a service file under /etc/systems/service/serviceName.service like jenkins https..service

Data:
[Unit]
Description=Automate Https Jenkins (any description you can give)

[Service]
User=jenkins (username)
ExecStart=/path/to/bin/java -jar /path/to/jenkins.war --httpPort=-1 --httpsPort=8888 --httpsKeyStore=/path/to/file.jks --httpsKeyStorePassword=change it &

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target


Give service file as : chmod 754 /etc/systems/service/serviceName.service


Run to enable service:
systemctl enable serviceName.service

Start service:
systemctl start serviceName.service

Check status:
systemctl status serviceName.service

Check config list:
chkconfig --list

If make any changes in service file then reload it:
systemctl daemon-reload

---
In general 
ExecStart=/path/to/bin/java -jar /path/to/jenkins.war --httpPort=portNo.


_______
Multiple env Deployment with approval
	Make group in Jenkins by adding approval list of people for respective applications
		adding that group in ConfigurationGlobalSecurityInJenkins -> add group like OrganisationName*GroupName
