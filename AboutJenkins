1. Download jenkins war file

2. See compatible requirements for system and java

3. Log in as root user then create  /var/lib/jenkins2 directory

4. export JENKINS_HOME=/var/lib/jenkins2

5. go to /var/lib/jenkins2
	then put jenkins.war file here and run command : java -jar jenkins.war 

	if want to use another port then execute : java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8085

6. Go to browser to access jenkins by http://localhost:8080 (by default) or http://localhost:8085 (if give http port explicitly), now give initialized password then install plugins. After that it will ask for configure username and password

7. If somehow jenkins service stopped then run same commands as installation for start service like "java -jar jenkins.war" or "java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8085"
